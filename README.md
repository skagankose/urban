# Urban

This is me trying to create a Reddit like social network for my university.
(Python 3.4 is used.)

TODO:

    - Secure vote functions with: if request.method == 'POST':
    - Add categories to entries
    - Add profile page
    - Add multiple file upload(?)
    - Add password change mechanism
    - Configure settings to sent email for registration and sign ups
    - Use redux for registration
    - Add suggestion mechanism etc. (Advanced!)
